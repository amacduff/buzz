						<h2>Professional Bio</h2>
						<p>Simon Foster is a freelance front-end web designer based in London, England. He specializes in intuitive, easy to use and beautiful responsive websites for projects both large and small that work on any type and size of device. His work has a heavy leaning towards simplicity and typography with a gimmick free focus on content and concise communication.</p>
						<p>Simon believes that though simplicity is not itself an aesthetic, a website can still have a visually pleasing or illustrative design, as long as there is no superfluous design noise that gets in the way of its function. He has been nominated for all kinds of awards, but humbly says that's not what it's all about. For him, the important thing is the fact that he enjoys what he does.</p>

						<h2>A Bit of Advice from Simon</h2>
						<p>“I always say that people starting out need to focus more on the ‘why’ and less on the ‘how’. One mistake I made early on was trying to learn every bit of Photoshop, or every CSS selector or something like that. You don’t need to do that – These things you’ll learn as you go along. It’s more of a case of thinking about why you’re making websites, why you’re designing something, why you’re in this industry. What difference are you gonna make? What does your work say about the world? Don’t focus too much on the process, it’s more about ‘Why are we here? Why are we doing this?’ Because ultimately, when you end up working on websites that have a lot of users, that’s when it comes into play, because you’re going to be making stuff that has a purpose.” *</p>
