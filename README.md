# Buzz Proposal
A web app connecting respected members of the design/tech community with people who look up to them.

## History & Intro
Austin is a tech city. There are many conferences to attend, and many respected minds travel there to speak. If you're bold enough, you might be able to meet someone you look up to. That can be challenging, though. Not everyone is outgoing, and even extroverts can have a hard time getting to someone they would like to meet. On the other side of it, many speakers would like to meet people who want to meet them, but meeting with a large group of people can be tricky, as well as draining.

Buzz is a way for respected members of the design/tech community to meet with someone who would really like to meet them. People would enter a drawing to win a meeting with a respected member of the design/tech community.

## Mission
To level the playing field so everyone has an equal opportunity to meet someone they admire.

## Challenges
Content strategy will be a challenge. It will be interesting coming up with content for a raffle application.

## Target Audience
Primarily new and up-and-coming designers and developers.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths
- Gives new / up-and-coming professionals a chance to meet a respected member of their field
- Currently no competitors
- Benefits any conference at which the person is speaking

### Weaknesses
- There might not be any real interest
- Conferences might not like the idea of people meeting with their speakers outside the conference
- People might not like the idea of a raffle

### Opportunities
- Possibility of working with conferences to set up meetings as a perk
- Possibility of collecting donations for charitable organizations as a fee for entry

### Threats
- Conferences could start organizing meetings like this as part of their schedule, eliminating the need for this app
- Speakers might decide something like this is too much to handle
